Involved in leucine biosynthesis.  Do not participate in the chain elongation of glucosinolates.  Expressed constitutively throughout the plant. Loss of IPMS1 can be compensated by a second isopropylmalate synthase gene IPMS2 (At1g74040). The mRNA is cell-to-cell mobile.	methylthioalkylmalate synthase-like 4	IPMS1, MAML-4
